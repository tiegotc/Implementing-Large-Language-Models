review_list: ["perfect lighting system when the lights go out. Battery life is excellent when fully charged can last up to 4 -5 days until it needs to be recharged again. Simple just leave it in the sun.",

               "lasted 5 months, with little use and battery dead. Absolute garbage, definitely not worth the money. RUBBISH",
